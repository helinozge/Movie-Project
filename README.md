## Animated Treasures:

**Introduction:**

   Animated Treasures is a specialty retail gift shop dedicated to celebrating the magic of animated storytelling. We offer a unique selection of themed merchandise inspired by beloved animated films, aiming to delight fans of all ages with products that bring their favorite stories to life.
   In 2024, with a wave of high-profile animated movie releases capturing global attention, Animated Treasures seeks to strategically align its sales and marketing efforts with the most impactful titles. Our goal is to increase revenue by ensuring our in-store offerings reflect current consumer interests and trends in the animation industry.
   To support this initiative, we will conduct a comprehensive data-driven analysis of animated films released in 2024. By gathering and evaluating online data—including box office performance, social media engagement, merchandise trends, and fan sentiment—we aim to identify the most popular and influential films of the year.
   This analysis will guide our product selection process, helping us determine which movie-inspired merchandise deserves prominent placement in our store. Through this approach, Animated Treasures will remain at the forefront of fan demand, offering products that resonate deeply with our customers and maximize commercial potential.
    
   For this project, we collected and analyzed publicly available online data related to animated movie releases in 2024. The main data sources include Online merchandise trends and box office performance.


**Main Challenges:**

  - Data may vary in format and reliability across sources.
  - Some metrics (e.g., social media engagement) may be inflated or not fully representative of purchasing behavior.
  - Real-time data collection can be complex and time-consuming.
  - Limited access to proprietary sales data from e-commerce platforms.

**Strengths:**

  - Combines multiple data sources for a holistic view of popularity and engagement.
  - Allows proactive, data-informed decisions about product stocking and marketing alignment.
  - Reflects real-time consumer interests and trends.

**Weaknesses:**

  - Data scraping limitations due to website policies or technical barriers.
  - Popularity does not always directly correlate with product sales performance.
  - May require regular updates to stay current with fast-changing trends.

**Questions:**
   - Which films are most associated with trending merchandise on platforms like Amazon?
   - Which 2024 animated films are driving the most consumer interest overall?
   - What types of products or characters are fans actively searching for online?
   - Which films show consistent popularity (not just a temporary spike)?
   - Which films are already generating strong merchandise sales online?

**Methodology:**
   To ensure that our in-store product offerings align with current consumer interests in animated films, we conducted a multi-step, data-driven analysis. Below is a breakdown of the methodology used throughout the project:

1. Film Selection and Dataset Creation
    Objective: Identify animated films released in 2024.
    Action: We compiled a list of relevant titles using film databases (IMDb, Box Office Mojo) and cross-referenced upcoming release calendars.
    Outcome: A curated list of 2024 animated films (e.g., Inside Out 2, Kung Fu Panda 4, etc.)

2. Data Collection from Multiple Sources

    To capture consumer interest from different angles, we gathered publicly available data across key platforms:

    Box Office Revenue: Collected earnings data to assess general public reach and popularity.
    E-Commerce Platforms: Monitored trending items and top sellers on sites like Amazon.

3. Data Cleaning & Preparation

     Normalization: Standardized film titles across datasets to prevent mismatches.
     Filtering: Removed irrelevant or low-signal entries (e.g., search trends for unrelated keywords).
     Missing Data Handling: Films with insufficient or noisy data were either flagged for manual review or excluded from trend scoring.
     Time Alignment: Ensured all data corresponded to the 2024 calendar year for consistent comparisons.

4. Data Analysis Techniques

     Trend Scoring: Combined normalized scores from Google Trends, box office earnings, and social media mentions to form an overall "popularity index."
     Sentiment Analysis: Applied natural language processing (NLP) on fan reviews to classify positive, neutral, and negative emotions toward each film.
     Product Opportunity Mapping: Matched high-performing films with trending merchandise categories to identify actionable sales opportunities.

5. Visualization and Reporting

     Created bar charts and line graphs for:
     Search interest over time
     Comparative box office performance
     Sentiment heatmaps for each film
     Summarized insights in clear markdown cells for integration in Jupyter Notebook or report format.
